# Task Tracker (Mobile-first)

A simple, mobile-friendly task tracker with three sections: **Today**, **This Week**, and **Future**.
Drag-and-drop tasks between sections, mark them done with a checkbox, and remove with a red trash bin button.

## Quick start (GitHub Pages)

1. Create a new repository on GitHub, e.g. `task-tracker`.
2. Upload these files to the repository root:
   - `index.html`
   - `icons/trashbin.svg`
3. Commit and push.
4. In **Settings â†’ Pages**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch** and choose the **main** branch and `/ (root)` folder.
5. Save. After it builds, your site will be live at the GitHub Pages URL for the repo.

> Tip: If you use a `docs/` folder instead of the repo root, move all files into `docs/` and select that folder in Pages settings.

## Local preview

Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build tools required.
